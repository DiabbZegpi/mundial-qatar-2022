# mundial-qatar-2022
The purpose of this repository is to make predictions and analysis of the world cup classification stage.

the following plot shows the results of 1 million simulations of the two final matches, within the South America's classification group. The assumptions are that every result has the same probability of occurrence. In the future, a web application will introduce the possibility of "moving" the individual probabilities of win, tie and lose.
